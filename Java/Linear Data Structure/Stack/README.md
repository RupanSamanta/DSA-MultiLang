# 🧱 Stack – Linear Data Structures in Java

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle. The most recently added element is the first to be removed. It supports basic operations like `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.

---

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- 🟣 **LIFO Order**: Last element pushed is the first to pop.
- 🟣 **Push**: Add element to the top.
- 🟣 **Pop**: Remove element from the top.
- 🟣 **Peek**: View the top element without removing.
- 🟣 **Fixed/Resizable**: Can be implemented using arrays (fixed) or dynamic collections.
