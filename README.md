## 📂 Structure

Each language will have its own folder, and inside that, topics will be categorized like:

```
Language 
    └──  Data Structures
            └── Linear Data Structures
                    └── Array
                    └── Stack
                    └── Queue
            └── Non-Linear Data Structures
            └── Algorithms
```
