# 📦 Array – Linear Data Structures in Java

An **array** is a linear data structure that consists of a finite, ordered set of **homogeneous elements**, stored in **contiguous memory locations**. Each element is accessed using a unique **index**, enabling efficient organization and **constant-time access (O(1))**.

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- 🟢 **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements must be of the same data type for consistent storage and operations.
- 🟢 **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: Elements are stored in continuous memory blocks for faster access.
- 🟢 **Index-Based Access**: Access elements using their index (starting from `0`), providing direct access in O(1) time.
- 🟢 **Fixed Size**: Size must be defined at creation and cannot be changed dynamically.
